# Generative AI Class Assignment: Recipe Generation with ChatGPT

## Assignment Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the practical application of generative AI in the context of recipe generation. Students will utilize ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to generate recipes based on specified criteria and constraints.

## Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will interact with ChatGPT to generate recipes for various dishes. They will explore how to prompt the model effectively to produce coherent and contextually relevant recipes. Additionally, students will analyze the output generated by ChatGPT, evaluate its quality, and propose improvements or modifications to enhance the recipe generation process.

## Assignment Tasks:

1. **Background Research:**
   - Conduct background research on generative AI models, particularly focusing on language models like ChatGPT.
   - Familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of such models in generating coherent text, including recipes.

2. **Prompt Design:**
   - Design a set of prompts to provide to ChatGPT for recipe generation.
   - Prompts should include specific dish names, key ingredients, cooking techniques, and dietary preferences or restrictions (if any).

3. **Recipe Generation:**
   - Use the prompts you have designed to interact with ChatGPT and generate recipes for the specified dishes.
   - Experiment with different prompt structures and lengths to observe variations in the generated output.

4. **Evaluation and Analysis:**
   - Critically evaluate the quality of the output generated by ChatGPT.
   - Assess factors such as coherence, accuracy of instructions, and suitability of ingredients.
   - Compare and contrast the recipes generated by ChatGPT with traditional human-written recipes.

5. **Improvement Suggestions:**
   - Based on your analysis, propose suggestions for improving the recipe generation process using ChatGPT.
   - Suggestions may include refining prompts, incorporating additional context, or implementing post-processing techniques to enhance the generated recipes.

6. **Documentation and Presentation:**
   - Document your findings, including the prompts used, generated recipes, evaluation results, and improvement suggestions.
   - Prepare a presentation summarizing your findings and insights, which you will deliver to the class.
