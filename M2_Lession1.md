# Lesson 1: Introduction to GitHub

In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of GitHub and introduce you to version control, a crucial concept in software development. By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of how to use GitHub for managing your projects.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently without overriding each other's work.

## Setting up a GitHub Account

If you haven't already, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up for an account. GitHub offers both free and paid plans, depending on your needs. Once you have an account, you'll be able to create repositories, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Basic Git Commands

Git is the version control system used by GitHub. Here are some essential Git commands to get you started:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clones a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commits changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

## Hands-On Practice

Now that you have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub, it's time to get some hands-on practice. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Add a new file or make changes to an existing file.
4. Use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to update the repository on GitHub.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the fundamentals of GitHub and introduced you to version control using Git. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective collaboration and project management in software development. In the next lesson, we'll explore how to collaborate with others using GitHub.

## Appendix 1: Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer not to use shell commands directly, GitHub Desktop provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with Git and GitHub. Here's how to get started with GitHub Desktop:

1. **Download and Install GitHub Desktop**: Visit the [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the application for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set it up on your machine.

2. **Sign in to your GitHub Account**: Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account credentials. This allows you to access your repositories and collaborate with others.

3. **Clone a Repository**: Click on the "Clone Repository" button and select the repository you want to work with from the list of your GitHub repositories. Choose a local path where you want to clone the repository to.

4. **Make Changes**: Once the repository is cloned, you can make changes to files directly within the GitHub Desktop application. Add new files, edit existing ones, or delete files as needed.

5. **Commit Changes**: After making your changes, you'll need to commit them to the repository. Write a descriptive commit message explaining the changes you've made, then click the "Commit to main" (or appropriate branch) button.

6. **Push Changes to GitHub**: To update the remote repository on GitHub with your local changes, click the "Push origin" button. This will push your commits to the remote repository, making them accessible to others.

GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly way to interact with Git and GitHub without having to use the command line. It's a great option for those who are new to version control or prefer a visual interface for managing their repositories.
