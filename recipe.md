# Peanut Butter Cookies Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the creamy peanut butter, granulated sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined and smooth.
3. Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of the dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
4. Using a fork, gently press down on each cookie ball to create a crisscross pattern.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are set and slightly golden around the edges.
6. Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
7. Enjoy your delicious homemade peanut butter cookies!

## Notes:
- Feel free to add chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or other mix-ins to customize your cookies.
- Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
