# Assignment 3.L1 - Designing a Short Story

In this assignment, you will design and outline an original short story under 3-5 pages to provide structure for an AI assistant to generate. You're not writing the story yet -- we're gathering data to use to have Generative AI write the story!

### Instructions:

1. **Generate Story Ideas:**
   - Use AI tools like the ones referenced to help generate ideas. For example:
     - *Fantasy Action Story Idea:* A young mage-in-training discovers an ancient artifact that grants immense power, leading to a conflict with dark forces seeking to control it.
     - *Noir Detective Story Idea:* A hard-boiled detective in 1940s Los Angeles is hired to investigate the murder of a wealthy socialite, uncovering a web of corruption and betrayal.
     - *Your Own Idea:* Using character ai and other tools, find an interesting idea for a story, and then ask several different GAI models to write it up as a "pitch" for a story.

2. **Create Main Character Profile:**
   - Use an AI character creator tool to craft a profile for the main character in 1 paragraph. Include details such as physical appearance, personality traits, background, and any other relevant information.

3. **Describe the Setting:**
   - Provide a brief description of the setting in 1-2 sentences. Generate descriptions of time, place, and atmosphere using AI tools if needed.

4. **Outline the Plot:**
   - Outline the plot in 3-5 sentences, identifying the key conflict and plot points. Consider the example stories provided for inspiration.

5. **Break the Story into Scenes:**
   - Divide the story into 5 scenes, describing key details for each scene in 1-2 sentences:
     - Characters involved
     - Setting
     - Main action/dialogue
     - Sensory/emotional details

6. **Specify Stylistic Elements:**
   - Specify any stylistic elements you want incorporated into the story in 1-2 sentences. This could include themes, motifs, narrative techniques, or specific writing styles.

7. **Target Length:**
   - Aim for a final length of 4-5 pages (~1000-1250 words) when fully fleshed out. (You may find this criteria useful when giving your AI models advice on how to make the ideas longer or shorter.)

8. **Compile into Story Bible:**
   - Compile all the above components into a single "story bible" document to guide the AI assistant in generating the story. This can be a word document, text file, etc. 

9. **Explain Intent for the Story:**
   - Reflect on your intent for the story in 1 paragraph. What themes or messages do you hope to convey?

10. **Reflect on the Creative Process:**
    - Reflect on the creative process in 1 paragraph. What strategies helped you design the story?
