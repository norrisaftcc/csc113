## Assignment 3.T2 - Finetuning your Character with RAG

In this follow-up assignment, students will delve deeper into the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by finetuning their characters created in the previous assignment. Building upon their initial interactions with the character.ai platform, students will further refine their characters' behaviors and speech patterns to better align with specific archetypes, personalities, or storytelling styles.

### Guidelines:

1. **Character Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the character created in Assignment 3.T1. Consider the archetype, background, personality traits, and any key attributes established during the initial creation process. Reflect on the character's behavior and speech patterns observed during interactions with the character.ai platform.

2. **Identifying Areas for Improvement**: Based on the analysis, identify areas where the character's behavior or speech could be finetuned to better reflect the desired archetype or personality. This may include refining dialogue, adjusting mannerisms, or reinforcing specific character traits.

3. **Engaging in Iterative Refinement**: Utilize the character.ai platform to engage in iterative refinement of the character. Engage in conversation with the AI character, providing examples of desired behavior and speech patterns to reinforce during the training process. Experiment with different prompts and scenarios to observe how the character responds and adjust accordingly.

4. **Observation and Reflection**: Throughout the refinement process, observe how the character evolves in response to input and examples provided. Reflect on the effectiveness of different approaches in shaping the character's behavior and speech patterns. Consider how the character's coherence and fidelity to the established archetype or personality improve over time. (Remember, "coherence and fidelity" refer both to if the character stays "in character" and also if they stick to their conversation style, such as first person or third person.)

5. **Documentation and Analysis**: Document the refinement process, including key observations, insights gained, and lessons learned. Analyze the effectiveness of different strategies employed in finetuning the character and reflect on the overall impact on the character's portrayal.

### Goals:

- Deepen understanding of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by actively finetuning characters based on specific archetypes or personalities.
- Develop skills in character analysis and refinement through iterative interaction with AI-generated text.
- Explore the role of collaboration and feedback in shaping AI-generated content.
- Reflect on the ethical considerations and implications of training AI models to emulate specific behaviors and personalities.

### Notes:

- You should experiment with different prompts and scenarios to elicit varied responses from the AI character. In character ai, you can most easily do this by making multiple "Conversation starters". You can also start a conversation off with your own prompt! 
- Double check that you're getting the desired behavior! (For example, if you want your character to speak in first person, with *emotes* in asterisks, then you should see examples of that both in the training data, and in the output.)
- An easy way to test characters semi-automatically is to create a room where they are with a "Narrator" character. (so far we've tried "Isekai narrator" and "Creepypasta narrator" with varying success.) 

### Reasoning:

This assignment builds upon the foundational knowledge gained in Assignment 3.T1 by providing students with a hands-on opportunity to deepen their understanding of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through iterative refinement of their characters. By analyzing, identifying areas for improvement, and engaging in iterative refinement, students will gain practical experience in shaping AI-generated content to align with specific archetypes or personalities. Additionally, the emphasis on observation, reflection, and documentation encourages students to critically evaluate their approach and consider the ethical implications of training AI models to emulate human-like behaviors. Overall, this assignment aims to foster a deeper understanding of RAG while honing students' skills in character analysis and refinement in a collaborative and iterative environment.
